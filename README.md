# dates-remainder
This is a personal application, you can use it. It is a simple app to record task with date and the app remind you when the date coming.

## Project description:
### App features.
- When you open the app, it will give you a list of your tasks to day, that your record in the past.
- The app give you the aplity to record any task for the future only. and you can't remove or edit the tasks added.
### App technologies:
App is bulied with two main technologies and two technecs of software architect:
- App technologies are:
    1. Java PL: I use it for improve my skills in it.
    2. Sqlite DB: I use it because the app is so sample and I doesn't have any future intends.
    3. JDBC driver: I use this driver as a reference to my app to help my java code comunicate with sqlite.
- App Software architecture technecs used:
    1. user-story technec: I use it to understand the application dimentios.
    2. CRC (Class-Responsipilities-Collaborators): I use it to descripe my application after I finished from user-stroy technec.
### Main Challenge I face in this project:
I build this app to use the user-story and CRC technecs after I learned them. And I'm not find challenge problem wiht them.
My challenging problem is to make a communication between java and sqlite db (It take 2 hours to do that).

## Installing and Runing:
### Install the project:

If you expert than me I expect that you can run this project in way easy than what I do. Put What I will explain is take some time becouse I can use the project only in VS code terminal.
folow these steps:
#### First Step:
If has not extensions to run java code install these extensions from vs code extensions:
- Extension Pack for Java (This extension contain all the extensions you need).
#### Second Step:
Install the jar file of [this web site](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.42.0.1)
#### Therd Step:
Open the project folder with vs code by type:
```
code .
```
In termenal when be in the diractory of the project "dates-remainder".
#### Fourth Step:
- In VS code environment in the EXPLORER tap, you will find in the buttom this tap: "> JAVA PROJECTS".
- Click on the tap and you will see new tap called: "> [] dates-reminder".

In VS Code enviroment go to **app** folder and open **Main.java** file.
about the **main** method, you will find ***Run*** word, Press it.
The project will run in terminall and you will can use it.

## How to use the application:
The app is so easy to understand. It has the constractrors if you flow them you will use full of it power.
