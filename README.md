# dates-remainder
This is a personal application, you can use it. It is a simple app to record task with date and the app remind you when the date coming.

## Project description:
### App features.
- When you open the app, it will give you a list of your tasks today, that you record in the past.
- The app gives you the ability to record any task for the future only. and you can't remove or edit the tasks added.
- The app give you the ability to see all previous recourds, but you should know that the app removes the taks that they being in the past.
### App technologies:
The app is bullied with two main technologies and two techniques of software architecture:
- App technologies are:
    1. Java PL: I use it to improve my skills in it.
    2. Sqlite DB: I use it because the app is so simple and I don't have any future intends.
    3. JDBC driver: I use this driver as a reference to my app to help my Java code communicate with SQLite.
- App Software architecture techniques used:
    1. User-story technique: I use it to understand the application dimensions.
    2. CRC (Class-Responsipilities-Collaborators): I use it to describe my application after I finish from user-stroy technique.
### Main Challenge I face in this project:
I built this app to use the user-story and CRC techniques after I learned them. And I do not find a challenging problem with them.
My challenging problem is to make a communication between java and SQLite db (It takes 2 hours to do that).

## Installing and Running:
### Install the project:
To install the project you can open your terminal and enter this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed101Mohammed/dates-remainder.git
```
### Run the project:
If you expert than me I expect that you can run this project in way easy than I am. What I will explain is takes some time because I can use the project only in the VS code terminal.
follow these steps:
#### First Step:
If you don't have extensions to run Java code install these extensions from vs code extensions:
- Extension Pack for Java (This extension contains all the extensions you need).
#### Second Step:
Install the jar file of [this website](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.42.0.1)
#### Third Step:
Open the project folder with vs code by typing:
```
code .
```
In the terminal when being in the directory of the project "dates-remainder".
#### Fourth Step:
- In VS code environment in the EXPLORER tap, you will find in the bottom this tap: "> JAVA PROJECTS".
- Click on the tap and you will see a new tap called: "> [] dates-reminder".
- Click on it and many taps will appear, Make the mouse over on this tap: "> [] Referenced Libraries"
- Then the plus + sign will appear. Press it and find the field that you installed in the ***Therd Step***.

#### Fifth Step (finally):
In the VS Code environment go to the **app** folder and open **Main.java** file.
about the **main** method, you will find ***Run*** word, Press it.
The project will run in a terminal and you can use it.

## How to use the application:
The app is so easy to understand. It has the contractors if you flow them you will use full of its power.

## How you can Contribute
I expect that you know how to fork and pull in GitHub.
All you can do is: pull your contribution with none strange files. And deep explanation about the bug that you solved or the feature that you added.
I hope you find a better way to run the app and upgrade the ReadMe file with it. But this way should work with me to accept it.
Thanks.
