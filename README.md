# dates-remainder
This is a personal application, you can use it. It is a simple app to record task with date and the app remind you when the date coming.

## Project description:
### App features.
- When you open the app, it will give you a list of your tasks to day, that your record in the past.
- The app give you the aplity to record any task for the future only. and you can't remove or edit the tasks added.
### App technologies:
App is bulied with two main technologies and two technecs of software architect:
- App technologies are:
    1. Java PL: I use it for improve my skills in it.
    2. Sqlite DB: I use it because the app is so sample and I doesn't have any future intends.
    3. JDBC driver: I use this driver as a reference to my app to help my java code comunicate with sqlite.
- App Software architecture technecs used:
    1. user-story technec: I use it to understand the application dimentios.
    2. CRC (Class-Responsipilities-Collaborators): I use it to descripe my application after I finished from user-stroy technec.
### Main Challenge I face in this project:
I build this app to use the user-story and CRC technecs after I learned them. And I'm not find challenge problem wiht them.
My challenging problem is to make a communication between java and sqlite db (It take 2 hours to do that).
